## About Me  
I am a social policy researcher and work with charites and local governemnts to amend inequitable systems and policies. I think software has huge potential to level the societal playing field, here's what I'm learning so far on [GitHub](https://github.com/Elloyouease).

I like making the following, in no particular order...
- perfume
- foraged pesto
- cocktails
- my younger brother fume

I think these were the best 00's tele shows, in a very particular order...
1. Buffy the Vampire Slayer
2. Charmed
3. Roswell High
4. Breaking Bad

I've been known to have Yoda qualities.<br> 
A nifty life hack, here is... <br>
It's called **GROWTH MINDSET**.

Essentially, we can all get better at doing something if we believe we can, we persevere, adopt good strategies and take action on feedback.<br>
>To help develop your growth mindset answer these 3 questions 
>- What do you know now that you didn't 1 year ago? (See, you can learn!)
>- What mistake did you make last week? What can you do to stop the mistake happening again?
>- So that thing you want do, what did people who succeeded do to get there?
