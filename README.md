## About Me  
I am a social policy researcher and work with charites and local governemnts to amend inequitable systems and policies. I think software has huge potential to level the societal playing field, here's what I'm learning so far on [GitHub](https://github.com/Elloyouease).

I like making the following, in no particular order...
- perfume
- foraged pesto
- cocktails
- my younger brother fume

I think these were the best 00's tele shows, in a very particular order...
1. Buffy the Vampire Slayer
2. Charmed
3. Roswell High
4. Breaking Bad

I've been known to have Yoda qualities. Here's a nifty life hack. It's called GROWTH MINDSET. Essentially, we can all get better at doing something if we believe we can, we persevere, adopt good strategies and take action on feedback. To help develop your growth mindset answer these 3 questions 
- What do you know now that you didn't 1 year ago? (See, you can learn!)
- What mistake did you make last week? What can you do to stop the mistake happening again?
- So that thing you want do, what did people who succeeded do to get there?
